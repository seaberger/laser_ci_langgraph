# Coherent Laser Spec Extraction Quality Evaluation

## Executive Summary
The extraction system captures some specifications but misses critical technical data from both HTML pages and PDF datasheets. Significant improvements needed in table extraction logic.

## Test Data
- **Products**: OBIS CellX, OBIS Galaxy, OBIS LX/LS
- **Sources**: 3 HTML pages, 3 PDF datasheets
- **Date**: August 23, 2025

## 1. HTML Extraction Performance

### What's Working ✅
- Basic table extraction functioning
- Some specs captured from CellX page (wavelength: 405nm, power: 100mW)
- HTML parsing doesn't crash or error

### What's Missing ❌

#### From CellX Web Page (Actual vs Extracted):
**Available on Page:**
- Wavelengths: 405, 488, 561, 637 nm
- Power options: 50-100 mW per wavelength
- Beam diameter: 2.6-4.5 mm (flow cytometry), 0.7 mm (microscopy)
- Beam divergence: 0.2 mrad (flow), 1.5 mrad (general)
- M²: ≤1.3
- RMS Noise: <0.25%
- Polarization Ratio: >50:1

**Actually Extracted:**
- Only wavelength 405nm and power 100mW captured
- Missing all beam quality metrics
- Missing noise specifications
- Missing temperature stability specs

### Root Causes
1. **Complex Table Structure**: Coherent uses multi-row headers and merged cells
2. **Nested Tables**: Specifications split across multiple nested tables
3. **Column Headers as Keys**: First column often contains spec names, not captured as keys
4. **JavaScript-Rendered Content**: Some specs may be dynamically loaded

## 2. PDF Extraction Performance

### What's Working ✅
- Docling successfully processes PDFs
- Text extraction works
- Some table data captured (9-23 specs per document)

### What's Missing ❌

#### From CellX Datasheet (Pages 3-5):
**Critical Specs in PDF:**
- Spatial Mode: TEM⁰⁰
- M² (Beam Quality): ≤1.3
- Beam Asymmetry: ≤1:1.2
- Pointing Stability: <10 μrad/°C
- Beam Colinearity: <100 μrad
- RMS Noise: <0.25% (20 Hz to 20 MHz)
- Peak-to-Peak Noise: <1% (20 Hz to 20 kHz)
- Long-Term Power Stability: <2% (8 hours)
- Warm-Up Time: <5 minutes
- Polarization specs per wavelength

**Actually Extracted:**
- Fragmented text with colons (9 items)
- Broken spec values (e.g., "≤1" instead of "≤1:1.2")
- Missing structured table data
- Extracted irrelevant content (legal notices, alignment instructions)

### Root Causes
1. **Table Structure Loss**: Docling not preserving table row/column relationships
2. **Colon Splitting Issues**: Simple colon split breaks specs like "50:1" ratios
3. **Multi-Column Tables**: Specs spread across 4 wavelength columns not captured
4. **Context Loss**: Values separated from their spec names

## 3. Extraction Quality Metrics

| Metric | HTML | PDF | Target |
|--------|------|-----|--------|
| **Spec Completeness** | 15% | 20% | >80% |
| **Value Accuracy** | 100% | 60% | >95% |
| **Structure Preservation** | Poor | Poor | Good |
| **Key Technical Specs** | 2/15 | 3/20 | >90% |

## 4. Critical Missing Specifications

### Never Captured (High Priority)
1. **Beam Quality**: M², divergence, spot size
2. **Stability**: Power, pointing, temperature
3. **Noise**: RMS, peak-to-peak
4. **Electrical**: Power consumption, voltage requirements
5. **Mechanical**: Dimensions, weight
6. **Environmental**: Operating temperature, humidity

### Partially Captured (Medium Priority)
1. **Wavelengths**: Only first one captured from tables
2. **Power**: Missing range/options
3. **Polarization**: Values broken by colon parsing

## 5. Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Enhanced Table Parsing**
   - Handle multi-row headers
   - Process merged cells
   - Extract all columns, not just first two
   
2. **Smarter Text Parsing**
   - Don't split on colons within values (e.g., "50:1")
   - Use regex patterns for common spec formats
   - Preserve units with values

3. **Docling Configuration**
   - Enable table structure preservation
   - Use TableFormer model if available
   - Export as structured JSON, not just markdown

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Template-Based Extraction**: Create vendor-specific extraction templates
2. **ML-Based Recognition**: Train model on laser spec sheets
3. **Validation Layer**: Check extracted values against expected ranges
4. **Manual Annotation**: Create ground truth dataset for testing

## 6. Validation Test Cases

### Test 1: Key Specs Extraction
```python
required_specs = [
    "wavelength", "power", "beam_diameter", 
    "beam_quality_m2", "noise_rms", "polarization_ratio"
]
# Current: 2/6 pass
# Target: 6/6 pass
```

### Test 2: Multi-Column Table
```
CellX 405 | CellX 488 | CellX 561 | CellX 637
405 nm    | 488 nm    | 561 nm    | 637 nm
50-100 mW | 50-100 mW | 50-100 mW | 50-100 mW
```
- Current: Only first column extracted
- Target: All 4 columns with proper association

### Test 3: Complex Values
```
Polarization Ratio: >50:1
Temperature Range: 10-45°C  
Beam Quality: M² ≤1.3
```
- Current: Values broken or missing
- Target: Complete value with units preserved

## 7. Conclusion

**Overall Grade: D+ (35/100)**

The current extraction system captures basic information but fails to extract the majority of critical technical specifications. The issues are systematic and affect both HTML and PDF extraction. Priority should be given to improving table parsing logic and preserving value formats.

### Next Steps
1. Implement enhanced table extraction for HTML
2. Configure Docling for better PDF table handling  
3. Add spec-specific parsing rules
4. Create validation tests with ground truth data
5. Monitor extraction quality metrics

### Expected Impact
With recommended improvements:
- Spec completeness: 15-20% → 75-85%
- Enable proper competitive analysis
- Support accurate normalized comparisons
- Reduce manual data entry needs
