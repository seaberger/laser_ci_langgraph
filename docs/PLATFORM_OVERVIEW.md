# Sightline Laser CI Module

## Executive Summary

The Laser CI Module is an advanced competitive intelligence component of the Sightline suite, providing automated discovery, analysis, and benchmarking of laser products across major manufacturers. As part of the broader Sightline ecosystem for knowledge engine, product finder, strategic marketing and competitive analysis, this module eliminates manual data extraction from competitor datasheets and websites, freeing business development managers and product managers to focus on strategic analysis rather than data collection.

## The Problem

Competitive intelligence in the photonics industry currently requires:
- Manual extraction of specifications from hundreds of PDFs and web pages
- Constant monitoring for new product releases
- Interpreting vendor-specific terminology across different manufacturers
- Maintaining spreadsheets with outdated information
- Missing critical competitive changes due to manual processes

**The Goal**: 100% elimination of manual data extraction from competitor materials, allowing teams to focus on strategy and analysis rather than data gathering.

## Our Solution

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Intelligent Product Discovery
- **Automated Search-Based Discovery**: Uses targeted search patterns to find products without manual URL entry
- **Dynamic Product Identification**: Continuously discovers new products as vendors release them
- **Smart Filtering**: Distinguishes actual products from accessories and parts

#### 2. Advanced Specification Extraction
- **Multi-Format Support**: Extracts from HTML tables, PDF datasheets, and complex layouts
- **Individual SKU Intelligence**: Splits product families into individual models with specific specifications
  - Example: One OBIS family datasheet → 47 individual OBIS models
- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically removes footnotes, units, and malformed data

#### 3. AI-Driven Normalization
- **Intelligent Field Mapping**: AI understands vendor-specific terminology
  - Recognizes "λ" = wavelength, "P_out" = power output
- **Canonical Schema**: Converts all specifications to standardized format
- **Hybrid Approach**: Heuristic patterns with AI fallback for unusual formats

#### 4. Change Detection and Monitoring
- **Content Fingerprinting**: SHA-256 hashing detects specification changes
- **Smart Caching**: Only processes changed content
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains complete specification history

## Integration with Sightline Suite

The Laser CI Module serves as the ground truth data source for the entire Sightline suite:

### Knowledge Engine Integration

- Prevents hallucination in technical documentation generation
- Ensures all product data is traceable to source documents

### Product Finder Integration  
- Supplies accurate, up-to-date product specifications
- Enables parametric search across verified data
- Powers comparison tools with real specifications

### Strategic Marketing Integration

## Ground Truth for AI Applications

### The Hallucination Challenge

Even advanced LLMs consistently hallucinate technical specifications:
- Fabricate model numbers that don't exist
- Generate plausible but incorrect specifications
- Mix specifications from different products
- Provide outdated information from training data

### Sightline's Ground Truth Solution

The Laser CI Module provides verified, source-attributed specifications that prevent AI hallucinations across all Sightline applications:

```json
{
  "product": "OBIS LX 488nm",
  "wavelength_nm": 488,
  "output_power_mw": 100,
  "source": {
    "url": "https://coherent.com/obis-datasheet.pdf",
    "page": 3,
    "extracted_date": "2024-03-15",
    "content_hash": "sha256:a7b9c2d4..."
  }
}
```

This enables AI-powered market research applications to:
- Generate reports with verified specifications only
- Cite sources for every technical claim
- Avoid liability from incorrect specifications
- Build customer trust through accuracy
