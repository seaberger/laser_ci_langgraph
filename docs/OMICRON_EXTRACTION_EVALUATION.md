# Omicron LuxX+® Extraction Quality Evaluation

## Executive Summary
Tested the improved extraction pipeline on Omicron LuxX+® lasers. While extraction quantity is modest (134 total specs), the HTML extraction shows issues with table parsing that need addressing. PDF extraction performed better with cleaner data structure.

## Extraction Performance Metrics

### Quantitative Results
| Source Type | Specs Extracted | Quality Assessment |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **HTML** | 87 specs | ⚠️ Poor - Table parsing issues, duplicate data |
| **PDF** | 47 specs | ✅ Good - Clean wavelength/power pairs extracted |
| **Total** | **134 specs** | **Mixed Quality** |

### Comparison with Other Vendors
| Vendor | PDF Specs | HTML Specs | Total | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------|-------|
| Hübner Cobolt 06-01 | 284 | 19 | 303 | Excellent extraction |
| **Omicron LuxX+** | **47** | **87** | **134** | **HTML needs improvement** |
| Coherent OBIS CellX | 194 | 35 | 229 | Good extraction |

## Quality Issues Identified

### 1. HTML Extraction Problems ⚠️

**Issue: Massive concatenated strings**
```
Key: "Wavelengths & Powers (other wavelengths and powers on request)"
Value: ['Modell Wavelength / Power LuxX® 375-20 375nm / 20mW LuxX® 375-70 375nm / 70mW ... [2000+ characters]']
```

**Problems:**
- Entire product table extracted as single value
- No individual spec separation
- Model names and specs concatenated together
- Same data duplicated multiple times

### 2. PDF Extraction ✅

**Better structure but limited quantity:**
```
"Wavelengths & Powers": ['LuxX+ ® 375-20', '375nm / 20mW', 'LuxX+ ® 515-100', '515nm / 100mW']
"LuxX+ ® 405-120": ['405nm / 120mW', 'LuxX+ ® 638-100', '638nm / 100mW']
```

**Positive:**
- Cleaner key-value pairs
- Model names separated from specs
- Wavelength/power associations maintained

**Negative:**
- Only 47 specs total (should be 100+)
- Missing technical specifications (beam quality, stability, etc.)

## Comparison with Source Document

### Expected Specs from PDF
The LuxX+® datasheet contains:
- **52 wavelength/power combinations** (375nm to 1550nm)
- **Beam specifications**: 1.0-1.5mm diameter, M² <1.15
- **Stability**: <0.5% / 8h long-term, <0.2% RMS noise
- **Polarization**: >100:1 vertical
- **Modulation**: >3MHz analog, >250MHz digital
- **Extinction ratios**: >1000:1 analog, >250:1 digital

### Actually Extracted
- ✅ Some wavelength/power pairs (partial)
- ❌ No beam quality specs
- ❌ No stability measurements
- ❌ No polarization data
- ❌ No modulation frequencies
- ❌ No extinction ratios

## Root Cause Analysis

### HTML Issues
1. **Table structure not properly parsed** - Pandas may be treating entire table as single cell
2. **Header detection failing** - "Modell" and "Wavelength/Power" not recognized as columns
3. **Row separation lost** - Individual products not split into rows

### PDF Issues
1. **Complex layout** - Two-column format may confuse Docling
2. **Incomplete extraction** - Only extracting partial wavelength table
3. **Missing specifications section** - Technical specs table not parsed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **HTML Table Parser**:
   - Debug pandas table extraction for Omicron format
   - Add fallback to split concatenated product strings
   - Implement regex to extract individual model/wavelength/power triplets

2. **PDF Extraction**:
   - Investigate why only partial wavelength table extracted
   - Check Docling handling of two-column layouts
   - Consider alternative PDF parsing for specifications table

### Code Improvements
```python
# Example fix for HTML concatenated strings
if len(value) > 500 and 'LuxX' in value:
    # Split on model pattern
    models = re.findall(r'(LuxX[^L]+(?=LuxX|$))', value)
    for model in models:
        # Extract wavelength and power
        match = re.search(r'(\d+nm)\s*/\s*(\d+mW)', model)
        if match:
            specs[f'{model}_wavelength'] = match.group(1)
            specs[f'{model}_power'] = match.group(2)
```

## Conclusion

### Extraction Quality: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- **PDF**: Partially working but incomplete (47/200+ expected specs)
- **HTML**: Major issues with table parsing (87 specs but mostly unusable)
- **Overall**: 134 specs extracted but data quality poor

### Key Differences from Hübner Success
1. Hübner had clean multi-column table structure
2. Omicron uses different HTML table format that breaks parser
3. PDF layout more complex with two-column design

### Priority Actions
1. Fix HTML table parsing for Omicron format
2. Improve PDF extraction completeness
3. Add specific handling for concatenated product lists
4. Test with other Omicron product pages

The extraction system needs vendor-specific improvements for Omicron, unlike Hübner which worked perfectly with the generic extractor.
